= Asciidoctor Deep Dive

This project includes samples for advanced corner cases that I experienced over time.
It also shows how to create a PDF file from Asciidoctor sources using Maven.

It's an example project for my talk 'Asciidoctor Deep Dive': +

As a special feature the PDF creation includes an extension to enable hyphenation.
As the German language contains long words this is essential as the layout would otherwise look quite ugly when using tables.

== Running PDF generation

You need to have Maven installed.
To run the PDF generation go the the _manual_ folder an issue _mvn compile_.
The first run takes some time as it will download dependencies from the web.
Subsequent runs will be faster.

You'll find the results in the folder _manual/target/generated-docs_.
