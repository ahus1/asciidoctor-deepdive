Every blank line creates a new paragraph.

Images can be in-line and as blocks.

An image:../include-files/chapter-1/sunset.jpg[width=70px] image in-line.

An image with a caption:

.This is an image
image::../include-files/chapter-1/sunset.jpg[]

For schematic drawings prefer to use SVG images for best results on the Web and in PDFs.
