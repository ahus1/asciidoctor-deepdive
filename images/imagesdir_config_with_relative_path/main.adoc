This is an example document with images referenced in chapters.

The images will show in the preview of the _main.adoc_ file without an additional configuration.
The paths given _chapter.adoc_ work when rendered in the preview of _main.adoc_.
For the images to show in the preview of _chapter.adoc_ stand-alone, the configuration in _.asciidoctorconfig_ is needed.
Have a look into the files in this project and its sibling for different approaches.
